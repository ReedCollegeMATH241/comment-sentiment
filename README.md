## Introduction

The goal of **sentiment analysis** is to extract the mood or attitude of a text's author. Techniques and knowledge from statistics, linguistics, and computer science must be combined to identify such information accurately.

**Hacker News** (HN) is a news aggregator focused on startups, science, and technology.

## The Question

What stories do HN commenters react to positively? negatively?

### Notes

This is my final project for Math 241: Case Studies in Statistical Analysis, a class at Reed College with instructor **Albert Kim**.
