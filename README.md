## Introduction

The goal of **sentiment analysis**, also called sentiment or opinion mining, is to extract the mood or attitude of a text's author. Techniques and knowledge from statistics, linguistics, and computer science must be combined to identify such information accurately. One example in the academic literature is [Hu and Liu 2004](http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/publications/kdd04-revSummary.pdf). This paper illustrates one prominent pplications of sentiment mining, which is the investigation of reviews (for any kind of product: movie, gadget, food, etc.) The information gained from the analysis helps determine which features of a product are most liked or disliked by users. This in turn guides business decisions, such as deciding which features to prioritize for revision in the next version of the product.

## Data

**Hacker News** (HN) is a news aggregator focused on startups, science, and technology. The data set for this project consists of comments made by HN users on articles posted by other users.

## Research Question

What stories do HN commenters react to positively? negatively?

### Notes

This is my final project for Math 241: Case Studies in Statistical Analysis, a class at Reed College with instructor **Albert Kim**.
