{"comment_text": "You know, I grew up alienated in an awful suburb, so I think I feel qualified to say: <i>that was fucking dumb.</i><p>Counterculture is indeed about rebelling against something, and it indeed dies on the vine when corporatized, mainstream culture has already absorbed it and there&#x27;s no more cheap-and-easy rebellion to be had.  But hey: suburbs are fucking alienating for everyone.  If your only moral or political principle on which to take a stand is, &quot;I feel alienated in suburbia&quot;, you&#x27;re about as Homo Sapiens as it gets.<p>The real lesson is not, &quot;counterculture should be preserved by having smart, rebellious, artistic kids grow up in the suburbs.&quot;  The real lesson is, &quot;This is why the overwhelming majority of people don&#x27;t choose to live in suburbs when there&#x27;s any kind of alternative available, but instead in either real cities or real countryside.&quot;<p>Also, for a bonus lesson: you can&#x27;t spend your life rebelling against the suburbs, or in fact against anything whatsoever.  At some point, you will either become just another hipster, or your &quot;rebellion&quot; has to be <i>for</i> something.", "author": "eli_gottlieb", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431270702, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:11:42.000Z", "comment_id": "9520120", "parent_id": 9519975, "story_title": "The Counterculture Is Better in the Suburbs", "story_id": 9519975, "story_url": "http://www.triggerwarning.us/the-counterculture-is-better-in-the-suburbs/", "points": null}
