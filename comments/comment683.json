{"comment_text": "That the retina has the receptive cells under the &#x27;cabling&#x27; is not novel and is well studied. The authors here introduce the study of the glial &#x27;supporter&#x27; cells and their refractive indices as wave guides for light to the receptive cells. This is actually pretty cool! Most neuroscience and physiology hasn&#x27;t considered this as an advantage before, just a quirk of evolution that the eye is &#x27;backwards&#x27;. Also, for other readers out there, the structure of the retina may be a good reference (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Retina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Retina</a>). To note: there are regions of the retina that differ in cone&#x2F;rod concentration. The Fovea, the center of our vision, is entirely cones, while the outside is almost entirely rods. Also, the receptive cells have many synapses where data is processed before it going to the optic nerve. The retina acts similar to an FPGA in that the whole data set is compressed before transfer.", "author": "Balgair", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276737, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:52:17.000Z", "comment_id": "9520467", "parent_id": 9518971, "story_title": "Human Eyes Are Wired Backwards", "story_id": 9518971, "story_url": "https://theconversation.com/look-your-eyes-are-wired-backwards-heres-why-38319", "points": null}
