{"comment_text": "I have a whole &quot;Git&quot; category on my <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;DailyTechVideo.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;DailyTechVideo.com&#x2F;</a> site, which are some of my favorite intros to Git.<p>Of these, my particular favorite is Michael Schwern\u2019s \u201cGit for ages 4 and up.&quot;  Watch this, and suddenly Git will make a ton  of sense.  Jessica Kerr&#x27;s talk about Git is a close second; it&#x27;s remarkable for telling us about how Git thinks about things without showing any code.<p>One of my favorite tools to use in my Git course is this site:<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wei-wang.com&#x2F;ExplainGitWithD3&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wei-wang.com&#x2F;ExplainGitWithD3&#x2F;</a><p>which graphically shows what happens when you commit vs. change branches vs. rebase.  Super cool stuff.<p>If you go through the two of these, and if you understand them, I think that you&#x27;ll have about 90% of what you need to then re-read a Git introduction, and have things make sense.", "author": "reuven", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431282678, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:31:18.000Z", "comment_id": "9520836", "parent_id": 9520825, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
