{"comment_text": "I have put out this idea before: in the far future, there will probably be a lot of ancient software in use that has been used and tested so much that it has very close to zero bugs or defects.

In my future world this will largely be open source code.<p>A counter to my future world with very high quality but slowly changing software would be the advent of strong AI.
