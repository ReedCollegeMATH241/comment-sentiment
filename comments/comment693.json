{"comment_text": "The (philosophical) question is one of affect. MMORPG&#x27;s in particular are designed to create a strong sense of attachment between avatar and player - how else will they convince you to keep playing? While it may not seem important to an outsider, to a player, the &#x27;expensive armor&#x27; and general appearance of a character creates a sense of attachment known only to its controlling player. As such, a traumatic break of this bond <i>can</i> have a corresponding psychological effect on the player. So yes - humiliating, executing, public shaming of a player can have significant effects on player and as such, we should consider the moral implications.", "author": "huac", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276584, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:49:44.000Z", "comment_id": "9520457", "parent_id": 9519157, "story_title": "Video game execution watched by 325K players", "story_id": 9518920, "story_url": "http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/08/video-game-execution-guild-wars-2-arena-net", "points": null}
