{"comment_text": "Life in Somalia varies depending one where you are. Most of the danger most people associate with the country happens in the south. I live in north in a autonomous region called Somaliland. Pretty peaceful, don&#x27;t have to worry about bomb blasts or whatnot.<p>I pay for 512k connection for $40&#x2F;month and the speed is as advertised mostly since my download clock in around 50kbps mostly. 1mb&#x2F;2mb&#x2F;3mb&#x2F;4mb go for $100&#x2F;$200&#x2F;$300&#x2F;$400 but I don&#x27;t bother paying for it since I have access to fast internet at the office.<p>My biggest worry about remote work is that employers would want me online all the time but my internet may go down more often than they&#x27;d tolerate (not to mention electricity going down). But for the most part the net and electricity only go down for minutes per day.<p>The best thing would be to work via email with someone who knows what they want and knows how to describe it well but I don&#x27;t know if that would be acceptable to most.", "author": "xtrumanx", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281143, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:05:43.000Z", "comment_id": "9520749", "parent_id": 9520516, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
