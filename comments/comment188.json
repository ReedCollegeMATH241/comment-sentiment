{"comment_text": "I like SmartGit enough that I paid $80 for it (despite the fact that it seems weird to pay money for dev tools these days).  You can download it and use it free for non-commercial use, though.<p>I&#x27;m reasonably comfortable with the git command-line tools, but for keeping the simple things simple I really do like an integrated all-in-one visual diff&#x2F;VCS client program and SmartGit is the best one I&#x27;ve used for git.<p>SourceTree (mentioned by fsk) is kind of a trainwreck on Windows, in my experience (moving to SmartGit was the result of me getting fed up with SourceTree and looking for something not as frustrating).  From what I understand the Mac version works better, though I haven&#x27;t used it.  While the UI is quite nice to start, the Windows version of SourceTree tends to soft-hang a lot (goes into non-responsive states it eventually recovers from, but will hang for like 30+ seconds at times) and it has a lot of weird issues with multi-monitor setups (it&#x27;ll sometimes randomly jump to the other monitor during pane resizing and such).", "author": "georgemcbay", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431287147, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:45:47.000Z", "comment_id": "9521083", "parent_id": 9520831, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
