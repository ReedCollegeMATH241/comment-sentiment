{"comment_text": "If you are not interested in a physician&#x27;s help, do not seek their help.<p>If you are interested in a physician&#x27;s help but do not want to take a specific medication or class of medications, things will get a bit more complex, but you should eventually be able to find a specialist who will work within the confines of your requests. However, limiting your treatment options in this way is hopefully not done lightly. Most of the medications that we have to offer do nothing for most people who take them. Abilify is one example, but it&#x27;s not really unique in this way.<p>If you are interested in a physician&#x27;s help but do not want to take a specific medication, yet your physician is insistent, it&#x27;s not helpful to lie to your physician to get out of it. I think it would make sense to seek a second opinion or transfer your care to someone with whom you can negotiate, rather than lying about trying a medication. What&#x27;s worse (for you) is that when you&#x27;ve finally had enough of this physician&#x27;s lack of success and you move your care elsewhere, your new physician will think you have already tried a medication that you have not in fact tried, and so they will form an incorrect view of what did and did not work for your condition.<p>In sum, be honest with your doctor about what you suffer, what you take, and what you want; if you feel that you cannot negotiate honestly with your doctor, keep looking until you find someone with whom you are willing to be open.", "author": "carbocation", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276235, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:43:55.000Z", "comment_id": "9520436", "parent_id": 9520039, "story_title": "Dodging Abilify", "story_id": 9520039, "story_url": "http://wp.rxisk.org/dodging-abilify/", "points": null}
