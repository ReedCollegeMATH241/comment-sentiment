{"comment_text": "There are laws against robbing trucks. I guess they will stay about as effective as they are now; it is not as if there aren&#x27;t ways for would-be robbers to stop a truck now (for example by crashing a stolen car in front of it)<p>As others said, the truck might call 911 before it has come to a stop. Also, 911 operators might get a remote override switch that allows them to instruct the truck to take some evasive action.<p>I do expect additional laws in the area of autonomous cars, but not to prevent robberies. If autonomous cars become really, really, good and ubiquitous, there is no reason for pedestrians to watch out for cars when crossing a street. That will lead to some funny, but disruptive (for the flow of road traffic) videos on YouTube (yes, you can play Frogger on a 8-line highway with your eyes closed and survive. The crocs aren&#x27;t robots yet, though)", "author": "Someone", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431291778, "created_at": "2015-05-10T21:02:58.000Z", "comment_id": "9521305", "parent_id": 9521164, "story_title": "Autonomous truck cleared to drive on US roads for the first time", "story_id": 9521015, "story_url": "http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27485-autonomous-truck-cleared-to-drive-on-us-roads-for-the-first-time.html#.VU-vqfSNFuE", "points": null}
