{"comment_text": "Yeah it&#x27;s a CYA move by MS. Same reason they don&#x27;t ship a telnet client by default. Or why you have to double opt-in for gzip with ASP.NET+IIS.<p>I&#x27;m guessing, like SELinux, what users end up doing is just disabling things completely (or enabling all options) instead of figuring out all the specifics. I understand, no one wants to be responsible for shipping a vulnerability by default, like MS products used to be.<p>Also see their terrible HTTP.SYS reservation system. Any program can listen on a socket. But if you want to use that socket for HTTP and use the OS-provided functions? Boom, special ACLs apply; enjoy figuring out a special one off utility. Or just run your service as a local admin.", "author": "MichaelGG", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277151, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:59:11.000Z", "comment_id": "9520491", "parent_id": 9520420, "story_title": "Microsoft nixes ActiveX add-on technology in new Edge browser", "story_id": 9519853, "story_url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2920892/web-browsers/microsoft-nixes-activex-add-on-technology-in-new-edge-browser.html", "points": null}
