{"comment_text": "&gt; I feel for Mrs. Chen, I really do.  The U.S Government should not have moved forward without solid evidence.<p>Reasonable, but it&#x27;s followed by a caveat which misses the key point:<p>&gt; However, after reading the article, several of her actions did and should have throw up some red flags. Flags which should have been (and were) investigated.<p>No one, including her, is claiming to be hurt by an investigation.  Government workers are investigate all of the time.  People with secret clearance <i>have</i> to have their lives investigated before the clearance is granted.<p>The bone of contention here is the <i>prosecution</i>.  A competent investigation would result in a report of &quot;No evidence of any malfeasance.  Much evidence of her following proper channels&quot;.  At that point, she might not even know that the investigation had taken place.<p>Someone who <i>truly</i> felt for her would feel for her <i>real pain</i>.  The pain of being falsely prosecuted.  And not spend most of the comment talking about &quot;An investigation is reasonable&quot;.<p>I find this attitude deeply disturbing.  This woman was abused by an incompetent, uncaring, or malicious prosecution.  Your response to that is similar to the prosecutors, TBH.", "author": "adekok", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431270524, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:08:44.000Z", "comment_id": "9520109", "parent_id": 9519178, "story_title": "Accused of Spying for China, Until She Wasn\u2019t", "story_id": 9518826, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/business/accused-of-spying-for-china-until-she-wasnt.html", "points": null}
