I have a hard time believing most Windows users who right now <i>think</i> they are getting &quot;Windows for free&quot; with their laptop and never have to worry about it again, would agree to pay Microsoft even $1 a month for it.<p>If there is no subscription then how will they charge users - per &quot;major update&quot;?

Do they still get security fixes?", "author": "higherpurpose", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290699, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:44:59.000Z", "comment_id": "9521230", "parent_id": 9521151, "story_title": "Microsoft to stop producing Windows versions", "story_id": 9521151, "story_url": "http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-32658340", "points": null}
