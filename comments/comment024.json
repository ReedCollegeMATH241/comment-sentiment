{"comment_text": "&gt; libraries are a bit like office politics for front-end web developers -- basically something that feels like work and &quot;advances your career&quot;, while in truth it&#x27;s just a way to avoid doing the real work with actual customers.<p>That&#x27;s pretty scary, if true. That sounds very analogous to academic research and the &quot;publish or perish&quot; state of affairs in academia today.<p>Office politics often <i>will</i> advance your career in any sizable organization. That&#x27;s why people engage in it.
