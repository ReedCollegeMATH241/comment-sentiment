{"comment_text": "Choosing Java over Ruby&#x2F;Python for your web-app really depends on what you want to sacrifice.<p>I counted LISP out because unless you&#x27;re using Clojure, I know for sure you&#x27;re not going to be able to beat anything else for web-app development. LISP for web-app probably works in the 90&#x27;s for PG but we&#x27;re in 2015 where libraries, frameworks, and tools for these other languages are just far too advanced and more productive than writing macros... sorry mate.<p>Anyway, back to Java over Ruby&#x2F;Python.<p>Take a few examples:<p>At the Microservice area, Java seems to shine over other languages&#x2F;platforms. JAX-RS feels more complete than Sinatra or whatever Django plugins that the Python community use. See a quick example of JAX-RS vs Sinatra somewhere in this blog post: (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appneta.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;microservice-service-oriented-architecture&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.appneta.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;microservice-service-oriented-ar...</a>)<p>Maven can be huge and underwhelming (and ugly once in a while) but it&#x27;s definitely more powerful than gems+bundler+rake and whatever Python adopts these days. Maven has been around for a while so most Java DEVs don&#x27;t have to pick up tools as Python DEVs have to do quite often. But again, there are trade-offs: Maven XML is definitely uglier than Bundler or requirements.txt or package.json.<p>Let me ask one thing: in platform other than Java, do you use declarative transaction? My guess is &quot;No&quot;. Which means you have to know when to open and close a transaction (and potentially join an existing one if the library isn&#x27;t smart enough). Java Spring&#x2F;EJB provides annotation based transaction.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that Java is better than other languages, but there are advantages of choosing Java.", "author": "edwinnathaniel", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431272503, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:41:43.000Z", "comment_id": "9520216", "parent_id": 9519681, "story_title": "A Java EE Startup: Filtering information with zeef.com", "story_id": 9519575, "story_url": "http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/a_java_ee_startup_filtering", "points": null}
