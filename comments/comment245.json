{"comment_text": "That is the oddest preemptive prescription I&#x27;ve heard of in a long time.  &quot;You might feel anxiety - so take Paxil&quot; which (a) is typically recommended for social anxiety and panic disorders and (b) it can take upwards of 4-6 weeks before it becomes effective.  I&#x27;m also quite sure that the antibiotic will have run its course in far less time.  But aside from that, who the hell prescribes an SSRI purely for &quot;possible&quot; anxiety?  Yes there are SSNRI, like Effexor and Cymbalta, that address chronic generalized anxiety and panic disorders.  But again, we&#x27;re talking about a long time before there&#x27;s any measure of efficacy.  The correct answer would have been to give you a few tabs of Atavan, Xanax, or Klonopin for the duration of the infection and then only after you experienced any anxiety.
