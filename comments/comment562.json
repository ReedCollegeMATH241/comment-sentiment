{"comment_text": "This is something I&#x27;ve also been wondering for a while (I live in Peru).\nMost of the folks I know follow this path: apply for a Master&#x27;s degree abroad and then try to find a way to stay in that country. But this is the thing: I&#x27;d love to work abroad without having to do a Master&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like reading&#x2F;writing papers, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a very optimal path to me.\nSo my current strategy is to build a portfolio on Github, get freelancing work online and then see if some company abroad hires me. Could this work? Could some company hire me based on my experience online?
