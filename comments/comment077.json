{"comment_text": "Most web servers out there implement one form of another of key  reuse usually via a dedicated SSL Session Cache otherwise their CPU&#x27;s would melt ;)\nOne of the main reasons that SSL is relatively cheap right now is that not only you have some level of hardware acceleration, but web servers are now every good at managing and reusing SSL sessions.<p>On NGINX the default TTL for an SSL session is 5min without constant keep alive, however on most installations that I&#x27;ve seen this has been extended significantly.\nYou can store about 4000 sessions in 1 MB of data, that vs the amount of CPU cycles a handshake will take is a no brainier for most server owners.<p>You can however configure your clients not to reuse an existing session, not sure how well servers will behave in that scenario, some servers which implement TLS actually use that feature as a security measure.<p>mod_tls by default iirc only accepts SSL data sessiona with the same key as the SSL control session while the SSL session is in cache which makes some clients (old curl for example) actually incompatible with it so you might have issues when you trying to pull a file from an HTTPS or FTPS&#x2F;SFTP service.", "author": "dogma1138", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290617, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:43:37.000Z", "comment_id": "9521225", "parent_id": 9520979, "story_title": "SKYNET: Applying Advanced Cloud-Based Behavior Analytics [pdf]", "story_id": 9520295, "story_url": "http://cryptome.org/2015/05/nsa-skynet-intercept-15-0507.pdf", "points": null}
