{"comment_text": "I think that&#x27;s missing the point. Even if the information appears benign, it&#x27;s still government trade secrets. Countries like China aren&#x27;t singularly focused on stealing super top secret blueprints for the U.S&#x27;s latest weapons technology (though I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d jump at the chance), much of their spying is on the more mundane stuff.
