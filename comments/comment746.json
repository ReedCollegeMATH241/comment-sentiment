{"comment_text": "&gt; Today&#x27;s beginners don&#x27;t make the tools.<p>Not necessarily, I am a beginner in hardware design, and I am creating a new programming language and IDE for hardware design.<p>&gt; The academics who trained us at uni had never worked in industry and had no real clue. Hence we had to learn the real stuff from the older guys.<p>I can relate, this is by talking to older designers that my co-founder and myself learned that CDC is a big thing to address for instance. But a lot of times we were just dismissed as too young and inexperienced.
