{"comment_text": "Perhaps OT: I often swing by Java web&#x2F;services frameworks every year or so and I never see a good DB migration&#x2F;evolution story.  I&#x27;m fairly certain that it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t know where to look or that I&#x27;m thinking about it incorrectly, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a Java web&#x2F;services framework that supports the easy database migration&#x2F;evolution schemes of Django&#x2F;South or of Rails.  Are these migration schemes not supported for a reason?  Or am I missing the docs?", "author": "CoffeeDregs", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277384, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:03:04.000Z", "comment_id": "9520505", "parent_id": 9519575, "story_title": "A Java EE Startup: Filtering information with zeef.com", "story_id": 9519575, "story_url": "http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/a_java_ee_startup_filtering", "points": null}
