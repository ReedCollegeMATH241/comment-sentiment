{"comment_text": "There are two major problems with this article.<p>First, the example of rape that it begins with is not just a rape, but an attempted murder (she survived only by sheer luck). Therefore, using it as an example of police and&#x2F;or society not caring enough about rape, is simply wrong. One could equally argue that that particular anecdote shows that police and&#x2F;or society don&#x27;t care enough about murder, or the combination of rape and murder.<p>Second, the example is of a complete stranger attacking out of the blue. We know those are very rare; most rapes happen between people that know each other. To use an example of the rare kind is disingenuous. Especially when that fact is very pertinent: many rape kits are not tested because their contents are not interesting, as both prosecution and defense agree sex took place - the two people may have been in a relationship - but disagree on consent. It is in some cases rational to not spend the police&#x27;s limited funds on a test whose result is already known.<p>With that said, there is a valid point: There are likely police that don&#x27;t care enough about crime, especially in poor areas. And DNA testing is straightforward - raise enough money, force police to test them, and you might catch some criminals. It is important to do that. But the article argues the point in a poor and misleading manner.", "author": "brighteyes", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431286109, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:28:29.000Z", "comment_id": "9521032", "parent_id": 9520272, "story_title": "Despite DNA, the Rapist Got Away", "story_id": 9520272, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-despite-dna-the-rapist-got-away.html", "points": null}
