{"comment_text": "if you&#x27;re starting with a block of aluminum or a bin of powdered aluminum, then yeah, the tooling for machining the solid block would likely take less energy than the laser used for sintering the powder.<p><i>However</i> if you take into account the energy necessary to cast the aluminum block in the first place, the laser may be more efficient.
