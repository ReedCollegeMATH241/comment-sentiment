{"comment_text": "The rolling&#x2F;incremental release is something that Apple does, but it&#x27;s not like Apple is the only company doing it.  Several Linux distros follow the same release model, and other software (not just OSes) does it too - MATLAB switched to this style model years ago, and it is nice at work to have something that is never more than 6 months out of date.<p>The only downside is that you have to really plan out deprecating features.  It&#x27;s easy to drop features when going from major release to major release, but in a rolling update, you need to give developers a heads up that things are about to change and give them time to fix things in their code.", "author": "olympus", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290883, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:48:03.000Z", "comment_id": "9521239", "parent_id": 9521218, "story_title": "Microsoft to stop producing Windows versions", "story_id": 9521151, "story_url": "http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-32658340", "points": null}
