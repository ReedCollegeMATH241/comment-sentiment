{"comment_text": "Stop giving up.<p>Seriously, if you feel like you&#x27;re giving up too early, don&#x27;t do that anymore. Keep going, even if you feel like it&#x27;s hopeless. Maybe not forever, but try going twice as long as you otherwise might.<p>You expect to feel magic. Either some kind of power that comes over you and makes you do the right thing without putting in the sweaty shit work, or that you&#x27;ll just start feeling like you can do it after a tiny bit of effort. Magic isn&#x27;t real; sweat is real.<p>Trust me, hard shit takes lot of work. And you might just suck at many of the things you try, because that just happens a whole lot. You&#x27;ll never get any better by abandoning it.<p>* there&#x27;s a whole lifetime of this informing my comments.", "author": "meepmorp", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431283660, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:47:40.000Z", "comment_id": "9520895", "parent_id": 9520205, "story_title": "Ask HN: I am giving up early on things I want to achieve.What is the way forward?", "story_id": 9520205, "story_url": "", "points": null}
