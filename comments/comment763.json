It partially solved a problem, but introduced significant risk.<p>It partially solves vitamin A deficiency, but we didn&#x27;t know how well until better tests had been done.<p>It also carries risks.<p>* Monsanto were including terminator genes or prosecuting farmers for re-using seed that didn&#x27;t have terminator genes. After intervention by orgs like WFP and WHO Monsanto agreed not to use terminator genes and agreed to allow farmers to collect and reuse seed. This one rice product has 70 patents from 30 different organisations. At the time the WHO and WFP were objecting the licencing situation was unclear.<p>* Vitamin A is toxic in overdose.  So, if people are getting vitamin A from rice you need to re-formulate your micronutrient supplement products to lower the vitamin A content.  That means you now have two versions (one with and one without vitamin A) (because the rice can&#x27;t be used everywhere) which complicates the entire chain from manufacture to end user supply.", "author": "DanBC", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431275255, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:27:35.000Z", "comment_id": "9520371", "parent_id": 9519502, "story_title": "How I Got Converted to G.M.O.
