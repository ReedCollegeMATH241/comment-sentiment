{"comment_text": "See &quot;A Note on Practice and Persistence&quot;:<p>&quot;As you study this book, and continue with programming, remember that anything worth doing is difficult at first.

Maybe you are competitive and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who&#x27;s been programming for more than 20 years.&quot;<p><a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnpythonthehardway.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnpythonthehardway.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;intro.html</a>", "author": "anon3_", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431278886, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:28:06.000Z", "comment_id": "9520603", "parent_id": 9520364, "story_title": "Ask HN: I am giving up early on things I want to achieve.What is the way forward?", "story_id": 9520205, "story_url": "", "points": null}
