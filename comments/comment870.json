{"comment_text": "I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that a professor should necessarily interact with all his or her students. I was more thinking of how I&#x27;ve seen many professors who obviously did not want to interact with their students because they wanted to focus on their research, and seeing as the current system appears to not punish this behavior, it is suboptimal in a teaching environment.<p>I think the system is fine in terms of not forcing all students to interact with their professors as that would lead to very shallow relationships. After all, many students go to college just to put it on their resume and help them land a job.", "author": "rifung", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431272782, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:46:22.000Z", "comment_id": "9520239", "parent_id": 9519110, "story_title": "What's the Point of a Professor?", "story_id": 9518814, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/whats-the-point-of-a-professor.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=c-column-top-span-region&region=c-column-top-span-region&WT.nav=c-column-top-span-region&_r=0", "points": null}
