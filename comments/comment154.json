{"comment_text": "Great job. For me personally, it&#x27;s very helpful to have an end-to-end tutorial, where all aspects of an (example) app are discussed. I don&#x27;t have a CS-background nor many years of coding experience, so a tutorial written by somebody who does have the proper experience and knowledge and puts it all together is extremely valuable to me. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d happily pay a fee for tutorials like this.<p>At the moment I&#x27;m working on building an app in Node.js with Express and sadly, there are not many tutorials of this quality.", "author": "matthijs_", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431288325, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:05:25.000Z", "comment_id": "9521124", "parent_id": 9518870, "story_title": "Django 1.8 and Python 3: Complex app tutorial, end-to-end", "story_id": 9518870, "story_url": "http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial", "points": null}
