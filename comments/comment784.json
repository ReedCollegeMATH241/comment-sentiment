{"comment_text": "&gt; it&#x27;s followed by a caveat which misses the key point<p>Which is a bit ironic since you missed <i>my</i> point. I agree she was abused by an uncaring and incompetent prosecution. I don&#x27;t think anyone disputes that. My point was that the article and the comments here and on the article seem to insinuate that she was free of culpability and should have never been investigated. Again, they&#x27;re treating this almost as if they just scooped a random person off the street and accused them of spying.<p>That could be further from the truth. She had all the red flags. Hell, she could still be a Chinese spy for all we know. Not that I believe it, but the only thing we know for certain is that the prosecution dropped the case. We don&#x27;t know <i>why</i> they dropped the case. A lack of evidence isn&#x27;t proof of innocence. Or she could have even been a double agent and maybe their prosecution was a miscommunication or an accident, or maybe it was to make everything appear more legit. Not that I believe any of that, but they do say reality is stranger than fiction.", "author": "mahranch", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431274790, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:19:50.000Z", "comment_id": "9520344", "parent_id": 9520109, "story_title": "Accused of Spying for China, Until She Wasn\u2019t", "story_id": 9518826, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/business/accused-of-spying-for-china-until-she-wasnt.html", "points": null}
