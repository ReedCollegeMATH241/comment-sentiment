{"comment_text": "God I hope not. Revolution has always been a shitshow and I don&#x27;t even want to think how it would look given technological advancement since the last time around.<p>There&#x27;s reason to hope. As a nation we have faced bigger issues than this and come out on top. Besides, there are still a handful of decent ways out. Social policy like reducing the workweek to restore supply&#x2F;demand balance in the labor market could work. So could basic&#x2F;minimum income, although I suspect that it&#x27;s politically untenable even though it would be cheaper in the big picture. The least efficient but most probable (IMO) approach would be to grow the size of our creaking, bloated menagerie of inefficient social programs.<p>So far, capitalist societies have generally been far better than Marx assumed at figuring out how to implement the minimum possible social policy to stave off rebellion. I don&#x27;t know whether to call it optimistic or pessimistic, but I suspect the trend will continue. Hopefully we won&#x27;t go full Orwell in the process, but I wouldn&#x27;t put money on it. We&#x27;re already turnkey-Orwell and I think most of us can tell which way the wind is blowing.<p>More optimistically, I think there&#x27;s also a chance that market dynamics will shift for the better due to technological change. Sure, 3D printing has been overhyped to the moon and back, but if rents are increasing while the inefficiency of distributed production is decreasing, then eventually there&#x27;s going to be a crossing point. Once everyone has self-replicating farms, power shifts back to the people and free market dynamics start working <i>for</i> the masses instead of <i>against</i> them. It&#x27;ll require a ton of effort and investment to make it happen, but that makes it just the sort of thing to provide opportunity to the HN crowd :)<p>&#x2F;crazy speculation", "author": "jjoonathan", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431269894, "created_at": "2015-05-10T14:58:14.000Z", "comment_id": "9520079", "parent_id": 9520030, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
