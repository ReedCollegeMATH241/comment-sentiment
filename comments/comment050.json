{"comment_text": "None in use.  Although I think that repositories for good software are like good literature and will stick around and be studied.  I could see people using it to study how we evolved the solutions, how we thought through problems (likely mocking us and laughing some), but hopefully learning where the field came from so figuring out where they can go and take us.<p>Just look to other sciences (biology, chemistry etc), we look back 200+ years and find that solutions to seemingly impossible problems were known all along but that some factor we needed to make it successful just didn&#x27;t exist yet (a Tony Stark moment).  Today we take it for granted I think in some cases that in the past 15 years we can do things with GPU&#x27;s, DSP&#x27;s etc that just 30 or so years ago were thought to be near insurmountable problems to solve in our lifetime.", "author": "davismwfl", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431291155, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:52:35.000Z", "comment_id": "9521259", "parent_id": 9519833, "story_title": "Ask HN: What Code That We Write Today Will Still Be Used in Ten Thousand Years?", "story_id": 9519833, "story_url": "", "points": null}
