{"comment_text": "My question is if the candidate did a degree at a good school doesn&#x27;t that prove anything? If they did a similar job for a competitor that doesn&#x27;t count or has a giant set of github repos does that not count? My feeling is that pressured puzzles are a cop out unless you are trying to filter out low level employees.<p>Also your comparison with share price is not necessarily accurate - #1 company in the past 100 years is Exxon (profit per 100 years). I would argue that they manage their existing employees better than their competitors and fire the weak ones. In 50 years I&#x27;ll bet no one knows facebook or google - just like no one knows DEC or any other tech company from the 70s except IBM and Oracle. Currently they just have the Zeitgeist going for them.", "author": "anthony_barker", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431270355, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:05:55.000Z", "comment_id": "9520100", "parent_id": 9518754, "story_title": "Ask HN: Why are Silicon Valley interviews such a drag now?", "story_id": 9518659, "story_url": "", "points": null}
