{"comment_text": "Banal conformity is not necessarily a bad thing. Boring perhaps, but <i>that</i> conformity is often why people move to cities like San Francisco, to be with like minded thinkers.<p>I grew up in the suburbs and went to college in a small conservative city. But, my family visited California when I was a child and I always liked it, although I&#x27;m not sure I could put my finger on &quot;why&quot; as a child. So, when I had the opportunity to do a college exchange program in California I jumped on it.<p>The first thing I noticed was that people felt comfortable being different. As someone who always felt like I didn&#x27;t belong, I immediately felt comfortable.<p>It took me about 10 years after college to make my way to California, but I finally feel at home.
