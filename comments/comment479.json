{"comment_text": "&gt; I&#x27;m just skeptical of a centralized authoritative body sanctioned to use force can [do better than enforcing property rights].<p>I disagree but this is not what I was calling the extremist position. If you are skeptical that there are better ways of achieving liberty than enforcing property rights then you still acknowledge that the fundamental desirable quantity is something other than the property rights themselves. You admit the possibility, as I believe any reasonable person would, libertarian or not, that under some circumstances the connection between enforced property rights and the underlying good may occasionally break down and that you must therefore always ask yourself if enforcing a particular notion of property in a particular instance is a good idea -- even if you tend to lean one way or the other by default.<p>(The &quot;particular notion of property,&quot; by the way, is the bit that is especially amusing to watch libertarians dance around. It&#x27;s possible to construct notions of property to make nearly anything seem reasonable or unreasonable, revealing the concept to be about as subjective as any other utility metric. But I digress.)<p>On the other hand if you take the position that property rights are a fundamental good in and of themselves, then you close your ears to arguments like &quot;X company is using Y strategy to take Z&#x27;s money without adding net value to the situation. They should be stopped.&quot; I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s reasonable. People find loopholes in the system all the time and if actions weren&#x27;t taken to stop them the world would be a miserable place even fuller of monopolies than it is today.", "author": "jjoonathan", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280659, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:57:39.000Z", "comment_id": "9520720", "parent_id": 9520343, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
