{"comment_text": "This isn&#x27;t directed at this particular post, but more to HN in general. Why do I now constantly see &quot;Tool XYZ (written in Go)&quot; as though this is a hugely important aspect? I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;Tool ABC (written in Java)&quot;, so what&#x27;s so great about Go? I know the features of the language help ensure &quot;safe&quot; development, but if someone was releasing software, I&#x27;d expect it to be relatively safe no matter what the language. So why is a tool being written in Go so important?", "author": "Velox", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279748, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:42:28.000Z", "comment_id": "9520655", "parent_id": 9520381, "story_title": "Rtop \u2013 agentless sever monitoring tool (built with Go)", "story_id": 9520381, "story_url": "http://www.rtop-monitor.org/", "points": null}
