{"comment_text": "Self replicating production facilities dramatically lower the barrier to entry for leasors, giving market leverage to consumers. If you can download open source specs for a personal farm and pit manufacturing shops against one another to build the thing, you&#x27;re still going to get a nearly rent-free price (in this ideal future where the technology exists to, e.g., print an automated tractor). To be more efficient, you could lease rather than buy, but this doesn&#x27;t change the underlying power balance: if production infrastructure is sufficiently cheap you can disintermediate the system for less than it would cost to be &quot;financially independent&quot; by subsiding on investment revenue. The system would be forced to compete.", "author": "jjoonathan", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279483, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:38:03.000Z", "comment_id": "9520634", "parent_id": 9520475, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
