{"comment_text": "To be fair, a lot of these corporate interests, if applicable broadly and without prejudice (unlikely), would just reinforce property right.<p>For instance, articles such as these always sensationalize some of the issues. This article claims that the agreement would allow corporations to sue governments for instituting policies that hurt their bottom line. This is probably  true but this would cover expropriation, which many people feel is unjust. I know many in US cringe at reports of Venezuela&#x27;s government expropriating business through force. Many would agree that if you have a law abiding business it would be wrong for the government to come in and take all your capital as their own. What I imagine corporations believe is that this should be interpreted more broadly.<p>For instance, if you agree that expropriation is bad, at what point does negatively harming a brand image effectively become expropriation? If a government makes you put a warning label? Plain packaging? Patent infringement?<p>Unfortunately, even if you agree with very strong property rights, this will almost certainly not be applied evenly and without special carve-outs.<p>edit: repatriation -&gt; expropriation", "author": "bko", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431270689, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:11:29.000Z", "comment_id": "9520119", "parent_id": 9520005, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
