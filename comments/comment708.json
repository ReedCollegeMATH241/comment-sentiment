Users of the SMTP mail infrastructure take advantage of the advanced features of EMS while remaining backward compatible with their current Internet messaging solutions. Distributed information on the Internet is indexed by Cario and browsed using the Explorer across thousands of information servers worldwide without the need of tools like WAIS and Mosaic. Windows becomes the global infostructure explorer.<p>The hottest content server on the Internet? Microsoft Marvel. It\u2019s already integrated with all of these services and has a huge content base and commercial vendor support. Perhaps most importantly, Marvel solves the difficult electronic commerce problem well ahead of the Internet: the ability to securely purchase goods in a networked environment. Cairo becomes the clear platform choice for new information providers, offering the most flexibility in both management and technology.
