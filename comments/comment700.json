{"comment_text": "Two thoughts: 1. Change your name to random-walk. You simply can&#x27;t use Pocket, as mentioned here by others. 2. Your project is basically unusable in it&#x27;s current state. Update the repo with build instructions so others can get it running. I spent my limit (15-20 minutes) trying to get it running in a container and failed. Happy to do a PR with the container file if you get that cleaned up. Making your project usable for others is a requirement to get traction!<p>Also, not cool using a pocket logo on the Google Play store. You need to fix that ASAP.", "author": "kordless", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276417, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:46:57.000Z", "comment_id": "9520447", "parent_id": 9520057, "story_title": "Show HN: OhMyPocket \u2013 Open-source version of getpocket.com", "story_id": 9520057, "story_url": "https://github.com/zhy0216/random-read", "points": null}
