{"comment_text": "Hi HN!<p>We build software to make buying a house simpler and more affordable. Ultimately, we want to make buying a house as simple as clicking a button. Our core technology is really our transaction process.<p>While we also provide some shopping tools for house hunters, we recognize that people don\u2019t just use 1 site when they\u2019re searching for a home. In the spirit of supporting our clients even if they\u2019er shopping on other sites, we made a \u201cbuy button\u201d that we hope will work anywhere. When you click, it looks for address and MLS# on your current page and fills them in on our offer form. It\u2019s the fastest way to make an offer on a piece of real estate.<p>Also it\u2019s open source, so if you find a real estate site that this doesn\u2019t work on, feel free to send us a pull request: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openlistings&#x2F;open_listings_chrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openlistings&#x2F;open_listings_chrome</a><p>Fun trivia: pg suggested we call it \u201cBuyjacking\u201d but we thought that sounded too much like we were stealing someone else&#x27;s business. We\u2019re just trying to build tools to make the buying process less painful and thought this was a fun idea in that spirit.", "author": "rgbrgb", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290374, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:39:34.000Z", "comment_id": "9521214", "parent_id": 9521210, "story_title": "Show HN: We made a Buy Button for real estate", "story_id": 9521210, "story_url": "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buy-this-home-with-open-l/bldldniiddmphkkghbibggfampdgpefc", "points": null}
