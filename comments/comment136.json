{"comment_text": "Sure.  It&#x27;s pretty straightforward.  Dawkins is making an argument against intelligent design.  He does so by setting up an artificial argument:\n1) The eye is &quot;backwards&quot;; light has to pass through the wiring\n2) any engineer dislikes disarray; why would they design a photoreceptor where the light has to pass through the wiring\n3) therefore, it&#x27;s unlikely that eyes were &quot;designed&quot;, for if they were, they would be much nicer and more tidy.<p>(see The Blind Watchmaker, &quot;This means that the light, instead of being granted an unrestricted passage to the photocells, has to pass through a forest of connecting wires, presumably suffering at least some attenuation and distortion (actually probably not much but, still, it is the principle of the thing that would offend any tidy-minded engineer)&quot;.<p>In short, Dawkins argument is weak- it appeals to design tidiness, not to any real facts or logic about how evolution works.  But as this modelling (oh, and I see they did some experimental work as well) shows, it&#x27;s just as likely that the mammalian eye configuration isn&#x27;t as bad as he said.<p>The arguments against intelligent design should be based on reality.  Dawkins is probably right about this sort of thing (that there is no ID), but he&#x27;s typically right for the wrong reason (specious logic).<p>(Dawkins then further argues against parallel evolution, although we&#x27;re now finding out it&#x27;s also quite common.  he&#x27;s wrong about a lot of things).<p>I should further argue that finding the eye in this configuration &quot;backwards&quot; according to some, is really just applying human aesthetics about how things should be engineered, where biology is a combination of happenstance and optimization.  I suspect, as we tease out the biophysics of the eye further, we will find many more examples of how Dawkins&#x27; simple logic (which isn&#x27;t really logic, but more based on aesthetics and intuition) doesn&#x27;t really explain things.", "author": "dekhn", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431288779, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:12:59.000Z", "comment_id": "9521146", "parent_id": 9520179, "story_title": "Human Eyes Are Wired Backwards", "story_id": 9518971, "story_url": "https://theconversation.com/look-your-eyes-are-wired-backwards-heres-why-38319", "points": null}
