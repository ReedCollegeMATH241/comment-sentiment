{"comment_text": "When I&#x27;m drunk enough to not be able to stop my hiccups, they usually go away naturally without me even noticing them as I sober up. I eventually give up trying to control it after I notice it&#x27;s futile, and the awareness that I&#x27;m even having them goes away. The hiccups themselves barely register and are quickly forgotten.<p>A couple of times I&#x27;ve gotten home realization dawns that I&#x27;m still hiccuping. Two, three hiccups later, they&#x27;re gone. There&#x27;s something about being alone in my room that makes me more capable of doing the technique than when I&#x27;m at the bar.", "author": "vinceguidry", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280058, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:47:38.000Z", "comment_id": "9520673", "parent_id": 9520414, "story_title": "Human Eyes Are Wired Backwards", "story_id": 9518971, "story_url": "https://theconversation.com/look-your-eyes-are-wired-backwards-heres-why-38319", "points": null}
