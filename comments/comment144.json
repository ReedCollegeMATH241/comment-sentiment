{"comment_text": "It&#x27;s at the bottom of the article, but I think it&#x27;s worth noting that Jon Peterson does some impressive work for role playing game historical documentation. His book Playing at the World is a labor of love, giving not only a detailed history of the early days of wargames and tabletop rpgs, but a history of the science fiction and fantasy genres, a history of games in general, and how those lead to the creation of modern rpgs. He then wraps things up with a chapter on how tabletop gaming influenced the star of the video game industry.<p>The scope is huge, the book is giant, and he published it under his own imprint so that no one could tell him to cut things. I found the section on Kriegsspiel particularly interesting. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re an enthusiast for the subject, otherwise you&#x27;d probably get very frustrated.", "author": "esoteric_wombat", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431288538, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:08:58.000Z", "comment_id": "9521136", "parent_id": 9519956, "story_title": "Your cyberpunk games are dangerous", "story_id": 9519956, "story_url": "http://boingboing.net/2015/05/08/your-cyberpunk-games-are-dange.html", "points": null}
