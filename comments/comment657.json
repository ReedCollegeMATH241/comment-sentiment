{"comment_text": "I don&#x27;t think either deterrance nor rehabilitation, the traditional justifications for criminal punishment, really work. I think the value of criminal punishment is that it reinforces social norms among all those who observe or know about the punishment (that and retribution for the victims). With regards to violent crimes, imprisonment reinforces the social norm that the state has a monopoly on the use of violence.<p>I don&#x27;t think that justification is as important when we&#x27;re talking about what&#x27;s essentially a commercial crime. It doesn&#x27;t even implicate personal safety in the same way as say burglary. These cattle are just assets on a balance sheet.", "author": "rayiner", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277365, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:02:45.000Z", "comment_id": "9520503", "parent_id": 9520417, "story_title": "Where\u2019s The Beef?", "story_id": 9519106, "story_url": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wheres-the-beef/", "points": null}
