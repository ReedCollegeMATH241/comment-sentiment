{"comment_text": "&quot;Proof&quot; in the legal sense is not the same as in the mathematical sense. Courts can decide which witness can be trusted and which can not. You can be sentenced even if there was a possible explanation how things could have happened without you committing a crime. In the end it matters, what the jury thinks.<p>What the jury thinks about possible rape cases is of course depended on societies overall attitude to the crime and the involved group of persons. To give an extreme example: I would say, that a few years ago, many would never think that a priest could also be a rapist. Without the possibility in mind it is hard to convict somebody of something.<p>So we have to be very careful. There are a few cases of people ruining other peoples lives by accusing them, but most of the time, when somebody claims to be a rape victim and you have found DNA samples, probably it was indeed rape.", "author": "allendoerfer", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279088, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:31:28.000Z", "comment_id": "9520610", "parent_id": 9520559, "story_title": "Despite DNA, the Rapist Got Away", "story_id": 9520272, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-despite-dna-the-rapist-got-away.html", "points": null}
