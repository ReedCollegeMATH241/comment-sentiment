{"comment_text": "<p><pre><code>  &gt; How would a company even determine if I&#x27;m worth hiring\n  &gt; and going through all the work to get me a work visa\n  &gt; if they can&#x27;t even interview me in person?\n</code></pre>\nNo company will hire you without an in-person interview. Most companies will pay for your plane tickets and hotel for an in-person interview.<p>A note on in-person interviews:<p>You will probably be flown to Europe and do the interview in English. Most English speakers in Europe learned it as a second language. If you learned English from a local Somali school, your interviewers will not be used to your accent and may have a hard time understanding you. You should practice your accent until you sound close to British or American.<p><pre><code>  &gt; Would they tolerate my crappy internet if they try to\n  &gt; interview me over Skype?\n</code></pre>\nIs your connection good enough to do a voice call at high quality? If it is, that should be sufficient.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to find a way to skip the initial phone interview. Most software companies do phone interviews to screen out candidates who are not capable of programming. A good substitute is a portfolio of personal projects on GitHub, showing experience with the programming languages you put on your resume.<p><pre><code>  &gt; What if the position was for something mid-to-entry\n  &gt; level and not some key position.\n</code></pre>\nThis will depend on the size of the company. I work at Google, and the legal department here will handle the immigration, visa, and permanent resident process even for regular low-level engineers. Smaller companies will be more selective.", "author": "jmillikin", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277474, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:04:34.000Z", "comment_id": "9520513", "parent_id": 9520328, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
