{"comment_text": "Classes is a big enough portion of sugar to change expression level of code. After writing ES6 few months I don&#x27;t like to write ES5 again, when I have to, and there is a lot of people who think so. Arrow functions is the another (if not first) big thing which makes this feeling stronger, and it&#x27;s just a syntax sugar also.\nOO in ES5 looks less readable and less.. &quot;native&quot; than in ES6.\nHope in some ES version &#x27;this&#x27; insanity will be fixed and all will be just fine with classes.<p>just for note: I have never used &quot;extends&quot; in ES6.", "author": "EugeneOZ", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431284435, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:00:35.000Z", "comment_id": "9520940", "parent_id": 9520735, "story_title": "Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript", "story_id": 9519904, "story_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript", "points": null}
