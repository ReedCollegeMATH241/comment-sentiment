{"comment_text": "This is ridiculous:<p>@carbocation: &quot;If you are interested in a physician&#x27;s help but do not want to take a specific medication or class of medications, things will get a bit more complex&quot;<p>You don&#x27;t understand the pressure the doctors are under to prescribe these things. A few years ago I was bit by a tick and a few months later I developed severe problems because of that tick bite. One of the problems was that my heart would sometimes race. The doctor put me on antibiotics to deal with the bacteria from the tick bite, but the doctor said I also had to take Paxil. I asked, why would I need to take Paxil to deal with a tick bite? She said the racing heart indicated anxiety, which needed to be treated. I said, if the bacteria causes anxiety, won&#x27;t that antibiotics resolve that? She said yes, but in the short term I needed to take Paxil. I asked, if the problem is assumed to be resolving in the short term, and the episodes rare, isn&#x27;t this a classic use-case for something like Atavan or Klonopin? We discussed it for a long time, and we went round and round in circles, but in the end she made clear that her decision in this matter was final: my choices consisted of taking Paxil or finding another doctor. Since this woman was a well known specialist in treating the kinds of bacteria that one can pick up from tick bites, I decided to take the Paxil. But it struck me as absurd then, and now, that I had to take Paxil to deal with a tick bite.", "author": "lisa_henderson", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431278638, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:23:58.000Z", "comment_id": "9520587", "parent_id": 9520039, "story_title": "Dodging Abilify", "story_id": 9520039, "story_url": "http://wp.rxisk.org/dodging-abilify/", "points": null}
