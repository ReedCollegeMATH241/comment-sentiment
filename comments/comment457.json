{"comment_text": "&gt; What&#x27;s more it wasn&#x27;t really a profit move (the universities don&#x27;t make any more money) as much as a who should pay move.<p>I was aware of that argument at the time, but has it panned out that way? I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised at figures showing either direction. e.g.<p>1. The initial loan&#x2F;funding is still from &quot;the government&quot; so from day zero, the government is most likely paying 3x the amount. It&#x27;ll be years before each student pays this back and until then, &quot;the government&quot; is hardest hit?<p>2. With the push to send more to university, there&#x27;ll be more students this year than e.g. 4 years ago. Did projections hold up? At \u00a327k&#x2F;head it doesn&#x27;t take a large % increase to make a considerable difference &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to hear that universities have far larger incomes than the past or projected.<p>3. And then you get into the issue of whether the majority will <i>ever</i> manage to pay off these loans... will we &#x27;all&#x27; end up paying for anyway in the end to cover the deficit...? Would it&#x27;ve been cheaper just to tax us to begin with before letting interest acrue?", "author": "pricechild", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281078, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:04:38.000Z", "comment_id": "9520744", "parent_id": 9520314, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
