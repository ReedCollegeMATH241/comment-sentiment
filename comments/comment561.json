{"comment_text": "I know this doesn&#x27;t answer your question specifically, but if you have a site and a product already launched, and if it is working, why change to just to accommodate a single person. Not to knock him or his skills, but that seems like spinning wheels when you could be out selling and improving.<p>Now if the site is not developed and you do not have a product, I would say do whatever you are most comfortable in to get it launched. There will always be the next great language out there and to second guess yourself now is just wasting valuable time.  PHP, while it has its moments, is not a bad language to build a product with. There are plenty of big name sites that got their start as PHP or are still built on PHP. I highly doubt that in the next few years that PHP developers are going to be a thing of the past.", "author": "jeffmould", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279238, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:33:58.000Z", "comment_id": "9520623", "parent_id": 9520546, "story_title": "Ask HN: Switching a business to PHP", "story_id": 9520546, "story_url": "", "points": null}
