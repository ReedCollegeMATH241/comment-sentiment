{"comment_text": "There is a lot of different companies out there in a lot of different places, so I can only answer from my experience. I am from Germany, I work in the US under a H1B visa.<p>All else being equal, most companies would prefer to hire someone from the US or someone who has a green card. But like you said, now many tech companies have trouble to find talented people. The company where I work has an especially hard time find mobile developers (iOS and Android). Those companies would be happy to hire you.<p>The problem in the US is that is actually very difficult to get a visa. Visa law is very complicated. I would say, read up on different kinds of US visas and see if there is one that could apply to you. There is also the &quot;green card lottery&quot;, where a certain number of people each year get an unconditional green card.<p>This all being said, unless you plan to study in the US I think your changes in the EU would be better.", "author": "ma2rten", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431278377, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:19:37.000Z", "comment_id": "9520571", "parent_id": 9520328, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
