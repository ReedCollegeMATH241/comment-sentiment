{"comment_text": "That&#x27;s how I got my first job out of college. Actually when I walked into the interview room, they had my program on a projector, the code loaded into an IDE, and asked me to explain everything. Then they loaded their apps on to the projectors and basically did the inverse for me. A very nice interview. The final portion was their most junior developer who told me just to ask whatever questions I wanted that would help me decide whether I wanted to work there.", "author": "logn", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431288335, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:05:35.000Z", "comment_id": "9521125", "parent_id": 9518932, "story_title": "Ask HN: Why are Silicon Valley interviews such a drag now?", "story_id": 9518659, "story_url": "", "points": null}
