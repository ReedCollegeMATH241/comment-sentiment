{"comment_text": "Nope. There are online universities that I could enroll in that offer Master&#x27;s degrees but I&#x27;m not interested in it. I looked up one school&#x27;s Master&#x27;s curriculum and it seemed pretty similar to the stuff I&#x27;ve learned doing my Bachelor&#x27;s that I didn&#x27;t bother going for it.<p>I&#x27;m also not interested in pursuing further higher education since I graduated university hating programming and now can&#x27;t imagine myself doing anything else. Don&#x27;t feel like going through that stuff again (though it&#x27;ll probably be a lot easier now that I can code).", "author": "xtrumanx", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277397, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:03:17.000Z", "comment_id": "9520507", "parent_id": 9520431, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
