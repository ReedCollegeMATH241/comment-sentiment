{"comment_text": "It may be an issue of terminology.<p>I personally think git is simple. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s <i>easy</i>. The issues listed in the GP comment seem to me mostly social. I think the most common problems with git stem from a more general difficulty in working with a branching, asynchronously developed codebase.<p>About merges... I think rebase is ridiculously overused, and people should use merges more. Clearly a feature branch littered with spurious merges is bad, but often it seems that this is taken simply to mean that merges are bad, and I get the impression that people go to ridiculous lengths with rebase etc. just to preserve an illusion of linear history even in cases where merging would be <i>better</i>.", "author": "chousuke", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431286556, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:35:56.000Z", "comment_id": "9521055", "parent_id": 9520775, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
