{"comment_text": "It&#x27;s fascinating how many great stories there are from this wild west period of the computer industry, thanks for a great writeup.<p>I have to pick a nit with footnote 10 though, &quot;There&#x27;s no need for a processor accessing bits in parallel to be little endian&quot; \u2013 there is when your data bus is narrower than the address bus, such as an 8-bit CPU performing indexed or relative 16-bit addressing. The simple pipelining of the little endian 6502 allows it to calculate the lower half of the target address while it fetches the upper half from memory, saving a cycle compared to the big endian 6800.", "author": "MagerValp", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431282832, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:33:52.000Z", "comment_id": "9520841", "parent_id": 9520210, "story_title": "The Texas Instruments TMX 1795: the first, forgotten microprocessor", "story_id": 9520210, "story_url": "http://www.righto.com/2015/05/the-texas-instruments-tmx-1795-first.html", "points": null}
