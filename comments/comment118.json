{"comment_text": "BassCSS is very different from Bootstrap or any other CSS framework. It&#x27;s more like &quot;classed inline styles&quot;, so you build your element styling like &#x27;border border-blue blue bg-white p1 m1&#x27; (blue border, blue text on white background, 1 unit padding, 1 unit margin) e.g. you mix-and-match different CSS classes to style your elements.<p>So, I was thinking using React + BassCSS, and build the class string in my React components. Not sure if it makes sense, but at least it would probably be a bit more manageable and faster to develop than inline styles. Inline styles could be added on top of that of course.", "author": "Geee", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431289277, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:21:17.000Z", "comment_id": "9521168", "parent_id": 9519811, "story_title": "React JS Best Practices", "story_id": 9515392, "story_url": "http://blog.siftscience.com/blog/2015/react-applications-that-scale", "points": null}
