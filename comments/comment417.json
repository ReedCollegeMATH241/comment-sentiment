{"comment_text": "Personally, I think &quot;blessing&quot; UI frameworks as JSRs (&quot;official!&quot;) is a bad idea.<p>I think it leads to the UI framework (e.g. JSF in the past or this new MVC spec) &quot;winning&quot; and getting adopted by teams who, if they had to evaluate several competing non-blessed frameworks, would pick something better&#x2F;easier&#x2F;more modern, but instead go with the JSR-backed option.<p>Although perhaps I&#x27;m just being pessimistic. JSRs can probably be a good thing; as a programmer in the JVM ecosystem, I&#x27;ve just never considered &quot;it&#x27;s a JSR&quot; as a brand of quality&#x2F;something that should affect my choice, and if anything it&#x27;s the opposite.<p>(My pessimism aside, if they&#x27;re basing the spec on existing good ideas, like JPA did for Hibernate, and JSR-310 did for Joda time, that is at least a smart approach.)", "author": "stephen", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281963, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:19:23.000Z", "comment_id": "9520796", "parent_id": 9519714, "story_title": "A Java EE Startup: Filtering information with zeef.com", "story_id": 9519575, "story_url": "http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/entry/a_java_ee_startup_filtering", "points": null}
