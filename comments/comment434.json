{"comment_text": "I teach courses on Git, and I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  <i>Many</i> of my students have been told that Git is simple, and they just need to know 10 commands.  Or they can think about it like SVN.  Or that they should push, pull, and that&#x27;s about it.<p>Which has the effect of (a) making them fear Git, (b) making them feel like they&#x27;ll never figure it out, (c) and convincing them that they&#x27;re always on the verge of losing data.  I&#x27;ve literally had students at the start of my course refer to Git as &quot;that system that makes me lose files.&quot;<p>Once I teach people about Git&#x27;s objects and data structures, things suddenly become much more obvious to these people. Git becomes less of a mystery.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that Git is easy for people to understand or use, because it isn&#x27;t.  It has a steep learning curve -- one which I think is worth the effort.  But I think that it does a disservice to Git newbies to try to summarize all of Git&#x27;s functionality in a short essay, and then proclaim, &quot;See?  There&#x27;s not that much to learn here!&quot;", "author": "reuven", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281515, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:11:55.000Z", "comment_id": "9520775", "parent_id": 9520670, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
