{"comment_text": "This article focuses on cases of rape in which DNA evidence did provide new information, though it&#x27;s worth noting that there are a number of kits that are never processed because there is no need - the disagreement is not on whether the rapist and victim had sex, but on whether it was consensual or not.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what percentage of cases this applies to, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the data on this is fuzzy to begin with. But it&#x27;s helpful to keep in mind because a large reason that so many rapists get away[0] is that it can be difficult to prove lack of consent, and the status quo is that justice system effectively defaults to assuming consent unless otherwise proven (at least in many cases), which has unfortunate consequences for both the victim and future victims.<p>[0] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidlisak.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;RepeatRapeinUndetectedRapists.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.davidlisak.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;RepeatRapei...</a>", "author": "chimeracoder", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276560, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:49:20.000Z", "comment_id": "9520454", "parent_id": 9520272, "story_title": "Despite DNA, the Rapist Got Away", "story_id": 9520272, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-despite-dna-the-rapist-got-away.html", "points": null}
