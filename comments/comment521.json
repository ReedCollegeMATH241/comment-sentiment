{"comment_text": "As others have said, you&#x27;d need to do &#x27;git fetch&#x27; first before &#x27;git status&#x27; would report a difference.<p>The reason git doesn&#x27;t do this automatically is because, in its simple model, it doesn&#x27;t waste time trying to connect to the remote &#x27;origin&#x27; or any other remotes you may have configured every time you do &#x27;git status&#x27;, which is most often used to check what you&#x27;ve modified locally.<p>I can understand why this would be jarring coming from SVN, where you always want to be checking against the remote&#x2F;server. Since git has a copy of all history locally, remotes are de-emphasized compared to centralized VCSs.", "author": "AceJohnny2", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280043, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:47:23.000Z", "comment_id": "9520671", "parent_id": 9520476, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
