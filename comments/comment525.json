Imagine going from no eyes to skin spots that are slightly more delicate than regular skin, but are precursors of light-sensing skin cells^1. Over the course of generations, eyes can evolve.<p>2. To not be too deleterious. One spot of more sensitive skin won&#x27;t cause the mutation to be immediately evolved away from; it&#x27;s just not that bad for the individual.<p>When you say it&#x27;s &quot;practically impossible to improve through random effects&quot;, what is &quot;practically impossible&quot;? How have you weighed that against the number of individuals in a population, the number of random mutations each offspring has, and the length of time we&#x27;re talking about? The question isn&#x27;t &quot;what are the chances a blind fish today has a baby with eyes tomorrow?&quot; This question both understates the number of trials evolution has to generate something, and pins the target of evolution. Instead, we should ask &quot;over millions of years, what are the chances that a given population evolves something useful?&quot;<p>[1] I&#x27;m not claiming this is exactly how eyes evolved.", "author": "zck", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279944, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:45:44.000Z", "comment_id": "9520667", "parent_id": 9520236, "story_title": "Human Eyes Are Wired Backwards", "story_id": 9518971, "story_url": "https://theconversation.com/look-your-eyes-are-wired-backwards-heres-why-38319", "points": null}
