{"comment_text": "Yeah, instead you had to get up off your ass and do some leg work. So you had to determine whether it was worth your time and the professor&#x27;s time to do so, instead of a quick and easy &quot;how do I do this work even though I&#x27;ve put in no effort to figure it out for myself&quot;.<p>Seemingly there is significant more hand holding of students and they all expect an A because simply showing up in high school meant they&#x27;d get an A. The entitlement is different now as well.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how far my school in particular has fallen in reality while in perception (god awful rankings) have them higher than ever. It&#x27;s the typical perception is more important than reality. However, this is good for students, because this is exactly my experience in the &quot;real world&quot; as well.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t trade my 90s undergrad for the crap kids are getting today. And I thought it was bad then. Hindsight makes me sad for the meager amount of actual learning going on today.", "author": "iolothebard", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431269965, "created_at": "2015-05-10T14:59:25.000Z", "comment_id": "9520083", "parent_id": 9519881, "story_title": "What's the Point of a Professor?", "story_id": 9518814, "story_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/opinion/sunday/whats-the-point-of-a-professor.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=c-column-top-span-region&region=c-column-top-span-region&WT.nav=c-column-top-span-region&_r=0", "points": null}
