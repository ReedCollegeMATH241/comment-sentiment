{"comment_text": "I&#x27;m always surprised at people who don&#x27;t try something, but then draw conclusions based on their ignorance. I&#x27;ve found that often in life I don&#x27;t get something until I try it.<p>Not dissing your attitude though... you aren&#x27;t really drawing conclusions from what I can tell, you&#x27;re just saying you don&#x27;t get it at this time. That&#x27;s pretty normal for most people, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. Nobody has a duty to get this stuff other than, say, mobile developers, or those working in fields it directly affects.<p>There have been a few people who have tried Apple watch, and have given it up. But even those people I think are drawing conclusions based on ignorance, because they are assuming that new apps coming out shortly won&#x27;t make the device more worthwhile.", "author": "natch", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431278551, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:22:31.000Z", "comment_id": "9520581", "parent_id": 9518687, "story_title": "Smart watches are dumb", "story_id": 9518352, "story_url": "https://medium.com/@brianscates/lets-be-honest-smart-watches-are-dumb-ec3b2bdb0d73", "points": null}
