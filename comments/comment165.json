{"comment_text": "Probably a controversial opinion to post here (not in that I think it is unique, but rather that I think there will be a divide in people who agree strongly and those who disagree strongly), but I view the JavaScript framework&#x2F;library situation as a damning indictment of how terrible the language is.  A constant churn of attempts to build a solid foundation upon a bed of leaky sand, each ultimately failing because no matter how well they were engineered you can&#x27;t get past the whole sand problem... and maybe the whole sand problem will solve itself by other means, but only at a very geological rate due to all of the committee politics surrounding browsers these days.<p>IOW, JavaScript is going to be great next year.  Just like it was going to have been each year for the past 10 years or so.", "author": "georgemcbay", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431287856, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:57:36.000Z", "comment_id": "9521110", "parent_id": 9520541, "story_title": "The abundance of JavaScript libraries", "story_id": 9520541, "story_url": "http://joonaspajunen.com/the-abundance-of-javascript-libraries", "points": null}
