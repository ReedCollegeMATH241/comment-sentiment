{"comment_text": "The simpler subset is useful for personal or internal projects, however, so it&#x27;s useful to have it spelled out.<p>(And BTW my own simple subset is still simpler - no branches, for instance, as it helps people delay merges which IMO they tend to overdo even without branches; also helps people pull and think they &quot;got the changes&quot; without actually running the new stuff. Also, my own understanding of rebases, detached heads etc. etc. is minimal at best and I seriously dislike having to learn that sort of thing and having to keep it in mind.)", "author": "_yosefk", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281500, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:11:40.000Z", "comment_id": "9520772", "parent_id": 9520670, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
