{"comment_text": "re: interview over skype -- isn&#x27;t there some better local connection, eg at a cafe or school or library?  As an interviewer, I&#x27;d be willing to be flexible around scheduling if you can figure out a quiet location w&#x2F; better internet.  It&#x27;s frankly better for me: I&#x27;ll have an easier time with your accent and get a better read on your capabilities.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, but you were born in Jeddah so I assume you&#x27;re muslim.  If I were you and considering living in the US, you&#x27;ll do far better if you stick to the coasts.  And probably better on the east coast (nyc, boston), just because there&#x27;s lots of visible muslims there so people won&#x27;t be freaked out by you.  My country can be very islamophobic (I&#x27;m sorry).", "author": "x0x0", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431284772, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:06:12.000Z", "comment_id": "9520955", "parent_id": 9520328, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
