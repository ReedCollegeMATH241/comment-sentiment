{"comment_text": "I wonder how long it will be before Apple can sue for some sort of infringement. I&#x27;m sure they will take full advantage of the opportunity.<p>In any case, this seems to me like the worst time for Microsoft to start copying Apple. Everyone&#x27;s been talking about how much Apple&#x27;s software is declining and how their update strategy is pushing things too fast, making OS X updates released as soon as the new features are good enough to show off in a keynote.<p>Of course, when Apple stopped updating the major version number, they actually had a reason - new kernel, new base system, and tons of incompatible changes. Hopefully, Microsoft&#x27;s focus on backwards compatibility will be enough to keep them from releasing the half-baked stuff that characterizes the current OS X.<p>My other worry with Windows is that it won&#x27;t get updated. Windows updates, in a business environment especially, don&#x27;t usually happen until they have to. And on a home computer, they will definitely need to copy Apple&#x27;s price point too, because I definitely do not see most Windows users (who use it because of how many other people do, and don&#x27;t pay extra for it; it&#x27;s just the thing that came with their computer) upgrading every chance they get. Even if they <i>do</i> release upgrades for free, it will still take some marketing to get people to upgrade.", "author": "0942v8653", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431291763, "created_at": "2015-05-10T21:02:43.000Z", "comment_id": "9521303", "parent_id": 9521151, "story_title": "Microsoft to stop producing Windows versions", "story_id": 9521151, "story_url": "http://m.bbc.com/news/technology-32658340", "points": null}
