{"comment_text": "The US has kept the Ottoman Empire divided with the EU for a long time (even coup&#x27;ed a democratically elected government), has neocolonialized South America, has couped and&#x2F;or occupied many other nations, denied anyone without an American passport the inalienable human rights enumerated by her Constitution, and has not intervened evenly on every crisis involving dictators and human rights violators.<p>The US does a great deal of good. But it also renders its own costs.<p>But to speak highly of her, if you would like me to do that, she has done and continues to do incredible things around the world including humanitarian assistance not riddled with policy objectives, treatment of epidemics and disastors, and some incredible interventions and transformations of societies (I do not begrudge what US NGOs&#x2F;CSOs are doing for North Korea).<p>&quot;Pax Americana&quot; could have been much worse, I think. And thank god she avoided nuclear war. We owe many people for that.<p>And either way I love her. I am no Anti-American.", "author": "xnull2guest", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290070, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:34:30.000Z", "comment_id": "9521197", "parent_id": 9520741, "story_title": "Whoever Is Leaking Trans-Pacific Partnership Drafts: Please Leak More", "story_id": 9519742, "story_url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/read/whoever-is-leaking-trans-pacific-partnership-drafts-please-leak-more", "points": null}
