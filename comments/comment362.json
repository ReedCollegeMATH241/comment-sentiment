{"comment_text": "I don&#x27;t really care much for the Windows version, but I&#x27;m a user of Arq on Mac OS. I used CrashPlan and Backblaze before that, for a couple of years, but had issues with both.<p>I would like to point out something many people overlook. If you use an online backup service, check how decryption is done. If you have to supply your decryption password to an on-line form, somebody has access to your data, and all the encryption has been for nothing (this was my problem with Backblaze).<p>Arq is great, because it decouples storage from backup. You pay for Arq, which buys you a backup program, and you buy storage separately, from any of the supported providers. You can also switch storage providers over the long term. I am very happy with this approach.<p>Arq has also proven to be much more reliable than either Crashplan or Backblaze&#x27;s client app.", "author": "jwr", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431283166, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:39:26.000Z", "comment_id": "9520864", "parent_id": 9519448, "story_title": "Arq for Windows finally available", "story_id": 9519448, "story_url": "https://www.arqbackup.com/arq-for-windows/", "points": null}
