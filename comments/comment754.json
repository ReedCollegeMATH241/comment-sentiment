{"comment_text": "Funny enough, that&#x27;s exactly how I got my current job. I have no code up on github or anywhere else, but I sent them a piece of a project I had worked on as a consultant (with permission from all the pertinent people). They were impressed with it. We discussed the decisions I made over the phone as well as my other views on software development and just like that I was hired. No in person interview required. The company is fully distributed, so they didn&#x27;t have an office I could go to anyway.<p>It&#x27;s also important to point out that the interview process went fast and smooth because I had the exact mix of skills they were both looking for and lacking at their company at the same time. Those skills in this case were PHP based CMS&#x27;s and single page web applications.<p>So, to OP, if you want the interview process to go better, identify a company that needs the skills you provide badly. Most mid-sized startups in SV who advertise that they&#x27;re hiring typically just need meat to scale their operations. Sometimes you can get lucky and use those opportunities to switch domains (ie: from JS web development to mobile game development) but most of the time those jobs just suck.", "author": "PopeOfNope", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431275392, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:29:52.000Z", "comment_id": "9520382", "parent_id": 9518932, "story_title": "Ask HN: Why are Silicon Valley interviews such a drag now?", "story_id": 9518659, "story_url": "", "points": null}
