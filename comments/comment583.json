Do:<p><pre><code>    cat .git&#x2F;refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;master\n</code></pre>\nin any git repo you have on your machine and see (compare it with &#x27;git log&#x27;)<p>If you have a remote branch that points to the same commit, all that means is that there is a text file called &quot;.git&#x2F;refs&#x2F;remotes&#x2F;origin&#x2F;master&quot; which has the contents &quot;a4300d840a4d01767cb2e768e51f7e88cb40e8cb&quot;. Again, that&#x27;s all there is to a remote branch.<p>Well, ok, there&#x27;s also an entry in your &quot;.git&#x2F;config&quot; file that gives the URI for &quot;origin&quot; (or whatever you&#x27;ve named your remote server; origin is the default).<p>All these files are just text files.
