{"comment_text": "the agentless&#x2F;agentful security question is an important one.   I mean, all existing snmpd implementations suck, right?  but the idea is that if you run snmpd (or another agent) on your monitored servers, if an attacker takes over your monitoring server, they still have to find an exploit in snmpd or whatever agent you use;  whereas in an agentless setup like this, if your attacker gains access to your monitoring server, said attacker has a (hopefully non-root) shell on all the monitored boxes.<p>On the other hand, installing this agentless setup is going to be dramatically easier, and this is way less likely to accidentally blow up the box being monitored, say, than snmpd.<p>(clearly, with snmpd and other agents, you want to make it so that only the monitoring server can see those services, either through tunnels or what have your.    Leaving a snmpd port open to the general internet is crazy.)", "author": "lsc", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431285734, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:22:14.000Z", "comment_id": "9521012", "parent_id": 9520381, "story_title": "Rtop \u2013 agentless sever monitoring tool built with Go", "story_id": 9520381, "story_url": "http://www.rtop-monitor.org/", "points": null}
