{"comment_text": "Author here. I created this little syntax for writing with less brackets one day. Less braces, less parentheses, and maybe less commas, less double quotes too. And Cirru is really interesting to myself.<p>And the idea behind CirruSepal is to write ASTs in Cirru Synax, such as ES6 AST(CirruScript), Racket AST, Julia AST. Actually I failed in generating LLVM IR from Cirru, so I tried Julia AST instead. It could be more fun if I had those skills.<p>Cirru Syntax is nice for exploring.", "author": "jiyinyiyong", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277139, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:58:59.000Z", "comment_id": "9520489", "parent_id": 9520469, "story_title": "A Lisp syntax with less parentheses", "story_id": 9520469, "story_url": "https://medium.com/@jiyinyiyong/a-lisp-syntax-with-less-parentheses-915384011008", "points": null}
