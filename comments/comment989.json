{"comment_text": "All indexes or rankings are &quot;biased&quot; in the sense that they are a weighted sum of different parameters that often have little to do with each other (adding apples and oranges). As such no index could be perfect for all since we have different values.<p>For example if you value freedom of speech a lot, the US would be way up compared to say, Germany (illegal to deny the Holocaust), if you value human rights, the death penalty is an aberration and the US would be at the bottom part of the index. If you value safety over rights, Singapore would have a high index, otherwise low etc.", "author": "lazyant", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431270103, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:01:43.000Z", "comment_id": "9520089", "parent_id": 9518748, "story_title": "Why we should't judge a country by its GDP", "story_id": 9518748, "story_url": "http://ideas.ted.com/why-we-shouldnt-judge-a-country-by-its-gdp/", "points": null}
