{"comment_text": "That it&#x27;s a huge mistake to use a BaaS for anything but a demo. I think it&#x27;s good to abstract out certain details that don&#x27;t pertain to your application logic, and that&#x27;s precisely what something like Heroku does. In my experience, a BaaS adds barely anything to that, and subtracts way more in terms of flexibility and lock-in.<p>The amount of administration that using a BaaS saves (as opposed to something like Heroku) is minimal; the time that you&#x27;d spend doing straightforward admin stuff is just moved over to working around limitations of the BaaS, and is often multiplied in the process. The amount of actual code that using a BaaS saves is between 100-400 lines for a web application.
