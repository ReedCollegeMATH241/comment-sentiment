{"comment_text": "I&#x27;ve used git for years after having spent years with SVN. no one taught me SVN and never really read much documetation. It was so simple and straightforward. Git introduces a lot of new power and features, but nowhere near the cost increase of the learning to use it. FWIW, I always hoped Mercurial would win. It&#x27;s at near feature parity with git, but is far easier to use.", "author": "tootie", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431283538, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:45:38.000Z", "comment_id": "9520885", "parent_id": 9520476, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
