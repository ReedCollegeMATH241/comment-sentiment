{"comment_text": "If you&#x27;re trying to say that OOP isn&#x27;t the central organizing principle of JavaScript, then I 100% agree with you. Lambdas and closures are awesome.<p>However, JavaScript does have the &quot;new&quot; keyword, and I would argue that constructors are quite central to JavaScript and good idiomatic JavaScript uses them. And it exposes YourConstructor.prototype, which I would argue is also useful.<p>So I guess maybe you&#x27;re saying something about the term OOP that I don&#x27;t understand. Maybe OOP means &quot;everything is an object&quot; to you? Or it means multiple inheritance?<p>I guess I don&#x27;t understand the distinction you&#x27;re trying to draw when you say &quot;not OOP&quot;.", "author": "erikpukinskis", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431284984, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:09:44.000Z", "comment_id": "9520967", "parent_id": 9520914, "story_title": "Introduction to Object-Oriented JavaScript", "story_id": 9519904, "story_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript", "points": null}
