{"comment_text": "Anyone know of a point and click graphical tool for git?  I&#x27;ve seen the branches and merges from the console but if I simply want to take git to a specific commit hash, it can easily devolve into hours of research.<p>I believe the problem here is that even though there are only a finite number of choices (less than a dozen in everyday life) representing what I want to accomplish, there are countless ways of getting there with commands.  I just don&#x27;t remember having these kinds of problems with svn, so I think the difficulty is not conceptual, but due to a poor mapping between the concepts and the interface.<p>I&#x27;m thinking something like Apple&#x27;s Time Machine, where you click a commit and the repo shows up on the desktop as a mounted drive.  We could use ordinary tools to edit the image and when it&#x27;s unmounted it becomes a new commit (or something along those lines).", "author": "zackmorris", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431282526, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:28:46.000Z", "comment_id": "9520831", "parent_id": 9520145, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
