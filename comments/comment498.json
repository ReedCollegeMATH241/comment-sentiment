{"comment_text": "I live in Spain and when you go to supermarkets, all price tags on the shelves and on supermarket-packaged products (pre-cut meat, for example) indicate the cost of the product per unit (big numbers), and per kilo (small numbers), so, if you want, you can quickly and easily compare a package of, say, 136g of meat with other packages, without weight interfering. You can see easily the price per kilo of each kind of meat.", "author": "harperlee", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280428, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:53:48.000Z", "comment_id": "9520697", "parent_id": 9504100, "story_title": "The Psychology of Pricing: A Gigantic List of Strategies", "story_id": 9501892, "story_url": "http://www.nickkolenda.com/psychological-pricing-strategies/", "points": null}
