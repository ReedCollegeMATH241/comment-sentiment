{"comment_text": "Yes it might work. It&#x27;s worked for thousands of people. Will it work for you? Well, it will depend on how well you execute and market not just yourself but also your work. Be strategic about how you show your work. Example: if you want to get hired by X startup&#x2F;company, go look up their jobs and find out what stack they use and tackle projects that might correlate to their specific needs. SHOW them what you can do. Don&#x27;t expect people to go to your Github to find a reason to hire you.<p>And remember to: Hustle hustle hustle. Setup web page alerts (I use Versionista <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;versionista.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;versionista.com</a>) for when a job page from a company you&#x27;re interested in changes or is updated.<p>And please, I can&#x27;t say this enough, learn to market yourself and your work!", "author": "hauget", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431279824, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:43:44.000Z", "comment_id": "9520657", "parent_id": 9520622, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
