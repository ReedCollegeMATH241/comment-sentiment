{"comment_text": "So the whole point of what I was getting at is that it&#x27;s a halfway point between super low-tech &quot;ssh -t host top&quot; and full-blown metrics reporting, the kind of thing where you want to check on some things across a bunch of hosts in a one-off way,<p>1) when you don&#x27;t have something like opsdash or datadog already set up<p>or<p>2) when you don&#x27;t want to bother creating some new metrics just for this one-off thing that will live forever in your auto-complete list of metrics<p>Having e.g. datadog set up is strategic:  knowing what is going on in your fleet over time (over long periods of time) is very useful (for noticing performance regressions, finding out cyclic traffic patterns, the list goes on).  Something like what I&#x27;m describing would be tactical rather than strategic.  It&#x27;s bubbling up to the top of my &quot;when I have some spare time&quot; side projects list, just because I want to explore whether it would be useful.", "author": "philsnow", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431285369, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:16:09.000Z", "comment_id": "9520991", "parent_id": 9520638, "story_title": "Rtop \u2013 agentless sever monitoring tool built with Go", "story_id": 9520381, "story_url": "http://www.rtop-monitor.org/", "points": null}
