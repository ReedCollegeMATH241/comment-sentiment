{"comment_text": "Those early clients barely had 30 million users and their daily actives were probably on the order of 20% of that. Whatsapp and Facebook messenger are approaching 1 billion users with daily actives at 70 to 80%. And far before that Skype trounced msn messenger.<p>What I was trying to say is, they spent their time trying to get a piece of a pie that was ultimately irrelevant. It served little if any business purpose and trying to usurp AOL users to get a vanity metric was a form of self delusion. You need loyal, deeply rooted users who care about your product and your network.  Trying to piggy back off someone else is applauded by short term people but you end up with a toxic and indifferent user base.", "author": "tsunamifury", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431290311, "created_at": "2015-05-10T20:38:31.000Z", "comment_id": "9521207", "parent_id": 9520969, "story_title": "Chat Wars: Microsoft vs. AOL (2014)", "story_id": 9519673, "story_url": "https://nplusonemag.com/issue-19/essays/chat-wars/", "points": null}
