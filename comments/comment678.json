{"comment_text": "I&#x27;m an SVN user, and I&#x27;ll have to move to git some day, but it&#x27;s not winning any points for me :-( . I got bit by it recently. I had cloned a repo, and then a few weeks later, did<p><pre><code>    % git status\n    On branch master\n    Your branch is up-to-date with &#x27;origin&#x2F;master&#x27;.\n    nothing to commit, working directory clean\n</code></pre>\nI assumed the working copy was up-to-date, as git states.... but alas, no. I had to do a &quot;git pull&quot; to get the latest changes.  Why doesn&#x27;t git tell you that your copy is out of date?", "author": "ajays", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431276929, "created_at": "2015-05-10T16:55:29.000Z", "comment_id": "9520476", "parent_id": 9520145, "story_title": "Git in six hundred words", "story_id": 9520145, "story_url": "http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-in-six-hundred-words", "points": null}
