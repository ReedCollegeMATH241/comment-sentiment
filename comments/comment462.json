{"comment_text": "I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about Go itself (as if that makes the software better), but moreso that if you&#x27;re a Go* developer, you may find the source of such a tool interesting - while Go seems particularly well-suited to writing system utils, perhaps there are parts of the codebase that seem like they may be difficult to implement in the language. Additionally, if the source is in a language one is familiar with, one may find that codebase leading to a deeper understanding of the tool itself.<p>* Go here being a proxy for any language. The same goes for Rust, Haskell, Javascript, etc - this trend certainly isn&#x27;t unique to Go.", "author": "notduncansmith", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280965, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:02:45.000Z", "comment_id": "9520739", "parent_id": 9520655, "story_title": "Rtop \u2013 agentless sever monitoring tool built with Go", "story_id": 9520381, "story_url": "http://www.rtop-monitor.org/", "points": null}
