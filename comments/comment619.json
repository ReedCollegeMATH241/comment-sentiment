{"comment_text": "Yeah it&#x27;s not great, but there&#x27;s a good reason why there&#x27;s an ACL for HTTP.SYS name reservations, a malicious application can actually reserve system reserved names, or overwrite the names of other services which already reserved a name such as the IIS or SQL server running on the machine. It&#x27;s quite an annoying thing to understand Windows permissions, especially when you are using built-in drivers and services such as HTTP.SYS. Also don&#x27;t forget that when you interact with HTTP.SYS you are interacting with a kernel mode driver, sockets can be bound in user space, so you are dealing with more privileged content.\nP.S. Network Service can use HTTP.SYS reservations, and pretty much anything else AFAIK.", "author": "dogma1138", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431278036, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:13:56.000Z", "comment_id": "9520554", "parent_id": 9520491, "story_title": "Microsoft nixes ActiveX add-on technology in new Edge browser", "story_id": 9519853, "story_url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2920892/web-browsers/microsoft-nixes-activex-add-on-technology-in-new-edge-browser.html", "points": null}
