But that was also true when I got the iPhone &amp; iPad.<p>&gt; Countdown clock is not a smartwatch feature, you can get that on a regular watch. Not sure why you&#x27;d mention that as a plus for a $400 Apple Watch.<p>Just a way I used it that&#x27;s different from what I did with my watch before.
