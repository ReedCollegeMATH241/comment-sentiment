{"comment_text": "Excellent timing.  So I have played most of the time since college in Python, bash, Perl, and very little Ruby (in that order).  I am going back to school to Java as part of my &quot;torture yourself with the basics you blew off&quot; undergrad career that was not CS, and now had a change of heart.<p>I have seen in &#x2F;r&#x2F;java and Reddit and elsewhere people eschew even for newbies the use of Spring Boot, Ninja, Dropwizard in company.  Some like you say Java EE is very friendly and I can write a full-featured REST service in like a dozen or so lines of Java.  Seeing as I wrote small pieces of homework &quot;employee ID insertion into memory&quot; classes in like 100-200 lines, can you show me said examples?  Hyperbole or not, I would love to see good articles about building REST services and other stuff in pure Java EE and&#x2F;or JAX-RS style explaining how a Java newbie can do this stuff.<p>I think other novates would greatly appreciate.  The expanse of Java web libraries is so vast even showing the minimalist modern style I am jealous of in your post would be a huge benefit to me.<p>UPDATE: Oh Jesus Christ!  Now I remember why the name Zeef seemed familiar.  You make that one of the few tutorial sites I found. Now, I will go crawl under the HN couch while onlookers stare and surpress chuckles.  Always read the articles, dammit!
