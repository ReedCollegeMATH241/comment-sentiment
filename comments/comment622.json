{"comment_text": "It seems completely foreign to me that someone would press a button like that and think there <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> be social consequences for it. I can&#x27;t think of a single thing I&#x27;ve ever done in my whole life that I wouldn&#x27;t or haven&#x27;t been judged for.<p>I was talking to a friend the other day about how &quot;people&#x27;s clothes don&#x27;t matter.&quot; I was saying that, yeah, in theory they don&#x27;t matter. I think they don&#x27;t matter. So when someone goes out of their way to dress oddly, I know it matters to them, and that contradicts my belief that clothes don&#x27;t matter.<p>So obviously they <i>do</i> matter, even if I want to believe they don&#x27;t. Things that don&#x27;t matter just don&#x27;t get attention. What is important is knowing why the important things are important, not simply what the important things are.<p>So even if people won&#x27;t care about a silly button press, they <i>will</i> care about your apathy to it.", "author": "Retra", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431277969, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:12:49.000Z", "comment_id": "9520551", "parent_id": 9516913, "story_title": "What Reddit's 'ridiculous' button tells us about mortality", "story_id": 9516393, "story_url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-32660378", "points": null}
