{"comment_text": "&gt; Quick tip for identifying people like this: if you are debating with someone and they quickly become emotional, angry, or start using a variety of logical fallacies (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fallacies\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_fallacies</a>), then you&#x27;re dealing with someone whose beliefs have no substance.<p>At this point, it&#x27;s worth noting that none of Xcelerate&#x27;s tips are provably true, and his advice is, at best, an anecdotal fallacy. Every single one of his methods for proving that a person&#x27;s beliefs are baseless are, themselves, baseless.\nPeople become emotional and angry for many reasons, and this is not tightly tied to the underlying rationality of their position. An anti-death-penalty advocate might have a long list of logically sound reasons for their belief (e.g. cost of error, ultimate in government overreach, etc), but they might become emotional because some aspect of state-sponsored executions touches their heart as well. Please do not fall into the fallacy that just because the person you&#x27;re debating gets emotional that they are necessarily wrong, or that you are necessarily right.<p>Further, people use logical fallacies all the time. It&#x27;s very hard to avoid them, unless one has practiced quite thoroughly.<p>Another common explanation for all of these phenomena is that you&#x27;re being perceived as a jerk.  For instance, if you&#x27;re the sort of person who says &#x27;I map all of people&#x27;s beliefs to a single arbitrary dimension and if their beliefs aren&#x27;t near mine, then they are almost certainly idiots who haven&#x27;t thought things through and can&#x27;t accept new evidence&#x27;, then I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m done with you.", "author": "kwyjiboo", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431280209, "created_at": "2015-05-10T17:50:09.000Z", "comment_id": "9520684", "parent_id": 9520375, "story_title": "The Counterculture Is Better in the Suburbs", "story_id": 9519975, "story_url": "http://www.triggerwarning.us/the-counterculture-is-better-in-the-suburbs/", "points": null}
