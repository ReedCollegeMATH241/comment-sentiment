{"comment_text": "I used to be in your situation, not because the market is bad in country ( programmers today have 0% unemployment rate) but because I hate the way companies work in place. You can start freelancing very easily. As long as you are a great programmer you&#x27;ll easily find freelance work or a remote job. I live in Portugal and there&#x27;s a huge demand for programmers and it&#x27;s growing each year, the same applies for the rest of Europe and US ( and possible other countries ). Keep in mind that hiring remote developers is always cheaper because of tax evasion, you&#x27;re a contractor not an employe that they have to pay social contributions. You need to research and set your hourly rate. Inform yourself about Escrow services, oDesk&#x2F;Upwork provides this service. Also don&#x27;t forget to pay your taxes and add this to your hourly rate.<p>If you want to increase your options: Create a blog and write great programming articles (I would appreciate it), engage in open source projects as a truly code collaborator, etc. Eventually you&#x27;ll have more options than you initially thought, you&#x27;re marketing yourself.<p>Bad internet connection? This might be a killer, for some people voice is fine but if you have a connection that work great when you&#x27;re in a video call in HD, it&#x27;s much better. Communication is key, trust me on this one.", "author": "mariopt", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431281070, "created_at": "2015-05-10T18:04:30.000Z", "comment_id": "9520743", "parent_id": 9520328, "story_title": "Ask HN: If I were your dream hire, would hire me?
