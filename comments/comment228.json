{"comment_text": "&gt; Build times, especially once the whole constellation of Yesod and Persistent packages are brought into the mix, are not insignificant. It still takes a good 5-10 min to build our larger web application on our beefiest machines. There are optimizations that can be made in this space which we haven&#x27;t adopted yet, such as caching already build object files to avoid having to re-compile them every time, so I&#x27;m confident this will be a non-issue in the nearby future, but it&#x27;s still worth being aware of. GHC works hard, you need to provide it with enough juice or time to let it do its job.<p>You hint at the solution to this problem when you mention caching, but I would encourage you to look into the Nix package manager. It&#x27;s platform and language independent, and is excellent at dramatically speeding up builds by only building anything once. It&#x27;s gaining popularity in the Haskell community.", "author": "thinkpad20", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431286120, "created_at": "2015-05-10T19:28:40.000Z", "comment_id": "9521033", "parent_id": 9519924, "story_title": "Haskell at Front Row Education", "story_id": 9519924, "story_url": "https://github.com/commercialhaskell/commercialhaskell/blob/master/usage/frontrow.md", "points": null}
