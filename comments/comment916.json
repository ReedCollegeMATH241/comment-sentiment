About 1&#x2F;3rd of them traveled during that time, most of the rest had a job.

I&#x27;m not claiming they included everyone with a summer job, just that what is claimed to be a &#x27;gap year&#x27; isn&#x27;t really in many cases, but more a &#x27;I have a few months time and I need to pay for my studies, let&#x27;s make some money&#x27;. A far cry from the GP&#x27;s suggestion that there is some formal structure to go soul searching or whatever.", "author": "roel_v", "title": null, "url": null, "timestamp": 1431271899, "created_at": "2015-05-10T15:31:39.000Z", "comment_id": "9520185", "parent_id": 9517190, "story_title": "Chile is introducing free higher education", "story_id": 9514404, "story_url": "http://www.attn.com/stories/836/chile-makes-college-tuition-free", "points": null}
